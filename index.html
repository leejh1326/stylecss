        <p>Hi, I am Jihye, class of 20. We could have met at school, but I'm sad that we can't attend the class together. I pray that the Covid will finish quickly and meet you offline in good health! Below is my introduction.</p>

        <p>I love cats. Our family cannot raise a cat because of the health of our family. That's why I'm living the life of an online butler who watches cat YouTube every day.  The channels I often watch are 'Kim Meju and Cats' and 'Haha ha'. Even the calm, cheerful cat's daily life is enjoyable, but it makes you smile when you see the humorous part that sometimes comes out. Take a look at it at least once. You could be a online butler, too.</p>

        <h2>My Works</h2>
        <img src="work.jpg" alt="work" class="img-fluid">
        <p>I am living a busy life because of midterm exams and assignments. There are still alternative tasks left, and it is also busier to participate in weekly web programming sungshin study group. It's hard due to a rush of tasks, but I'm enjoying my life because I feel a sense of accomplishment when I'm done.</p>
